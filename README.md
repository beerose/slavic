## How to start our awesome game:

  * have elixir
  * have nodejs
  * have npm
  * go to slavic dir
  * type: mix local.hex in case you don't have hex installed 
  * type: npm i
  * type: mix deps.get
  * finally type: npm start
  * go to http://localhost:4000 and play in our awesome game

  it should work. if not -- install whatever you need 
  or configure files in config dir however you need
  or.. use our bunch of useful links and tips:

  * https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html
  * https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
  * on some systems (linux systems especially) you need to 
    manually compile elixir, so..
      * clone git repo from: https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir
      * do what is said to do on the website above
  * make sure you have erlang installed
